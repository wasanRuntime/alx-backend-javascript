# Porting to the Buffer.from/Buffer.alloc API

## Overview

- [Variant 1: Drop support for Node.js ≤ 4.4.x and 5.0.0 — 5.9.x.](#variant-1) (*recommended*)
- [Variant 2: Use a polyfill](#variant-2)
- [Variant 3: manual detection, with safeguards](#variant-3)

### Finding problematic bits of code using grep

Just run `grep -nrE '[^a-zA-Z](Slow)?Buffer\s*\(' --exclude-dir node_modules`.

It will find all the potentially unsafe places in your own code (with some considerably unlikely
exceptions).

### Finding problematic bits of code using Node.js 8

If you’re using Node.js ≥ 8.0.0 (which is recommended), Node.js exposes multiple options that help with finding the relevant pieces of code:

- `--trace-warnings` will make Node.js show a stack trace for this warning and other warnings that are printed by Node.js.
- `--trace-deprecation` does the same thing, but only for deprecation warnings.
- `--pending-deprecation` will show more types of deprecation warnings. In particular, it will show the `Buffer()` deprecation warning, even on Node.js 8.

You can set these flags using an environment variable:

```console
$ export NODE_OPTIONS='--trace-warnings --pending-deprecation'
$ cat example.js
'use strict';
const foo = new Buffer('foo');
$ node example.js
(node:7147) [DEP0005] DeprecationWarning: The Buffer() and new Buffer() constructors are not recommended for use due to security and usability concerns. Please use the new Buffer.alloc(), Buffer.allocUnsafe(), or Buffer.from() construction methods instead.

    at new Buffer (buffer.js:148:3)
    at Object.<anonymous> (/path/to/example.js:2:13)
    [... more stack trace lines ...]
```

### Finding problematic bits of code using linters

Eslint rules [no-buffer-constructor](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-buffer-constructor)
or
[node/no-deprecated-api](https://github.com/mysticatea/eslint-plugin-node/blob/master/docs/rules/no-deprecated-api.md)
also find calls to deprecated `Buffer()` API. Those rules are included in some pre-sets.

There is a drawback, though, that it doesn't always
[work correctly](https://github.com/chalker/safer-buffer#why-not-safe-buffer) when `Buffer` is
overriden e.g. with a polyfill, so recommended is a combination of this and some other method
described above.

## Variant 1: Drop support for Node.js ≤ 4.4.x and 5.0.0 — 5.9.x.

This is the recommended solution nowadays that would imply only minimal overhead.

The Node.js 5.x release line has been unsupported since July 2016, and the Node.js 4.x release line reaches its End of Life in April 2018 (→ [Schedule](https://github.com/nodejs/Release#release-schedule)). This means that these versions of Node.js will *not* receive any updates, even in case of security issues, so using these release lines should be avoided, if at all possible.

What you would do in this case is to convert all `new Buffer()` or `Buffer()` calls to use `Buffer.alloc()` or `Buffer.from()`, in the following way:

- For `new Buffer(number)`, replace it with `Buffer.alloc(number)`.
- For `new Buffer(string)` (or `new Buffer(string, encoding)`), replace it with `Buffer.from(string)` (or `Buffer.from(string, encoding)`).
- For all other combinations of arguments (these are much rarer), also replace `new Buffer(...arguments)` with `Buffer.from(...arguments)`.

Note that `Buffer.alloc()` is also _faster_ on the current Node.js versions than
`new Buffer(size).fill(0)`, which is what you would otherwise need to ensure zero-filling.

Enabling eslint rule [no-buffer-constructor](https://eslint.org/docs/rules/no-buffer-constructor)
or
[node/no-deprecated-api](https://github.com/mysticatea/eslint-plugin-node/blob/master/docs/rules/no-deprecated-api.md)
is recommended to avoid accidential unsafe Buffer API usage.

There is also a [JSCodeshift codemod](https://github.com/joyeecheung/node-dep-codemod#dep005)
for automatically migrating Buffer constructors to `Buffer.alloc()` or `Buffer.from()`.
Note that it currently only works with cases where the arguments are literals or where the
constructor is invoked with two arguments.

_If you currently support those older Node.js versions and dropping them would be a semver-major change
for you, or if you support older branches of your packages, consider using [Variant 2](#variant-2)
or [Variant 3](#variant-3) on older branches, so people using those older branches will also receive
the fix. That way, you will eradicate potential issues caused by unguarded Buffer API usage and
your users will not observe a runtime deprecation warning when running your
