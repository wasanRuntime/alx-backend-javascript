  Generator based control flow goodness for nodejs and the browser,
  using promises, letting you write non-blocking code in a nice-ish way.

## Co v4

  `co@4.0.0` has been released, which now relies on promises.
  It is a stepping stone towards [ES7 async/await](https://github.com/lukehoban/ecmascript-asyncawait).
  The primary API change is how `co()` is invoked.
  Before, `co` returned a "thunk", which you then called with a callback and optional arguments.
  Now, `co()` returns a promise.

```js
co(function* () {
  var result = yield Promise.resolve(true);
  return result;
}).then(function (value) {
  console.log(value);
}, function (err) {
  console.error(err.stack);
});
```

  If you want to convert a `co`-generator-function into a regular function that returns a promise,
  you now use `co.wrap(fn*)`.

```js
var fn = co.wrap(function* (val) {
  return yield Promise.resolve(val);
});

fn(true).then(function (val) {

});
```

## Platform Compatibility

  `co@4+` requires a `Promise` implementation.
  For versions of node `< 0.11` and for many older browsers,
  you should/must include your own `Promise` polyfill.

  When using node 0.11.x or greater, you must use the `--harmony-generators`
  flag or just `--harmony` to get access to generators.

  When using node 0.10.x and lower or browsers without generator support,
  you must use [gnode](https://github.com/TooTallNate/gnode) and/or [regenerator](http://facebook.github.io/regenerator/).

  io.js is supported out of the box, you can use `co` without flags or polyfills.

## Installation

```
$ npm install co
```

## Associated libraries

Any library that returns promises work well with `co`.

- [mz](https://github.com/normalize/mz) - wrap all of node's code libraries as promises.
